# PLAN-32: Terminal: The Config Contract

epic: ui-improvements
workstream: WS-04

> Staged plan spec — one shippable unit of work, ready for hand-off on the `runbook` lane.
> This spec is SELF-SUFFICIENT: the emitted command is a one-line pointer and carries no brief.

## Objective

Align the config verbs and the specification once the operator decided which contract is right: the client's aspect endpoints or the transport table; give the mock the routes the decision keeps; align the `config` overview (CLI-UC-S-08 steps 3 and 4; CLI-UC-P-07).

Source of this plan (read before scoping):

- `doc/claude_review/cli/use-cases/proposals.adoc#CLI-UC-P-07`
- `doc/claude_review/cli/use-cases/findings-onboarding-entry.adoc`

## Deliverables

1. **Contract aligned**
   - What: Client or specification follows the operator's decision; the mock serves the kept routes.
   - Persona: plan-marshall:persona-implementer
   - Skills: pm-dev-java:java-core, pm-dev-java:java-lombok, pm-dev-java:javadoc, pm-dev-java:java-null-safety, pm-dev-java:junit-core, pm-dev-java-cui:cui-testing, pm-dev-java-cui:cui-logging
   - Done when:
     - `config show` works against the mock (evidence order: `test-first`)
     - Terminal check (screen capture) shows this deliverable's change as specified on: `fully-onboarded`: `config` overview and `config show`; before and after captures recorded (evidence order: `none`)
2. **Overview layout**
   - What: Values in one column; the prompt on its own line; every item the prompt offers is shown.
   - Persona: plan-marshall:persona-implementer
   - Skills: pm-dev-java:java-core, pm-dev-java:java-lombok, pm-dev-java:javadoc, pm-dev-java:java-null-safety, pm-dev-java:junit-core, pm-dev-java-cui:cui-testing, pm-dev-java-cui:cui-logging
   - Done when:
     - `ConfigCommandTest` asserts the layout (evidence order: `test-first`)
     - Terminal check (screen capture) shows this deliverable's change as specified on: `fully-onboarded`: `config` overview and `config show`; before and after captures recorded (evidence order: `none`)
     - The open-issue read at the pull request head is recorded: the open Sonar issue count and the rules left open (`unknown` for a failed read, never `0`); it is a confirmed `0` or every open issue is dismissed (evidence order: `none`)

## Standing Constraints

- Build and test through Maven only (CLAUDE.md). Beside the lane's build gate, these module builds pass at the head: `./mvnw -pl pm-operator verify -Pintegration-tests`, `./mvnw -pl pm-mock-runtime verify`.
- No new dependency or plugin unless this spec names it as approved by the operator.
- CUI standards (`CLAUDE.md`, `PLAN-77`): a test that takes input data draws it from `Generators` with `@EnableGeneratorController` (the expected value of a contract stays literal); a log call at INFO or above goes through a `LogRecord` of the module's own `LogMessages` class (one per module that logs, never one for the repository) with a `LogAsserts` test; `@NullMarked` applies in a module that declares JSpecify (`pm-operator`, `pm-mock-runtime`); until `PLAN-77` has landed the test-scope CUI dependencies are missing in `pm-api`, `pm-exec`, `pm-relay` and `pm-mock-runtime`, and a test there follows plain JUnit and reports the departure, never adds the dependency itself.
- Java 25, Lombok, records; no generic `Exception`/`RuntimeException`; JUnit 5 only, no Mockito (CLAUDE.md).
- Every new operator text goes through `MessageCatalogue` into `operator.en.properties` and `operator.de.properties`.
- Parked until the operator decides the contract (CLI-UC-P-07); the spec of the decision lives in `plan-marshall-documentation`.
- Terminal check of the rendered output through the screen capture harness of `cli-pty-dialogue-harness` (`ScreenCaptureIT`, command line in `doc/design/terminal-client/27-tui-testing.adoc`): write this plan's captures to `pm-operator/src/test/resources/screen-captures/{plan}.txt`, run the set BEFORE the change and copy `pm-operator/target/screens/{plan}/` to `.plan/temp/terminal/{plan}/before/`, then run it AFTER and copy to `.../after/`. Capture at 120 × 30 and 80 × 24 in `en_US.UTF-8` and `de_DE.UTF-8` unless the target names other sizes or environments. Read every `.txt` and `.attrs.txt` with the file tools and compare them with the deliverable; the screen text shows no raw id, link name, state id, `-` placeholder, ISO time or HTTP status, and no text of a previous level. Never run `pm-operator` in the agent's own shell: the operator gate refuses a coding agent by design (`PM-SEC-3`) and is never worked around; only the harness, which clears the environment like every PTY test, runs it. If the harness is not available, the terminal Done-when clauses are NOT met — a blocker, never skipped.
- This project analyses its pull requests with SonarCloud (project `plan-marshall_pm-mcp-clients`, `.github/project.yml`; provider `plan-marshall:workflow-integration-sonar` and step `default:sonar-roundtrip` in `.plan/marshal.json`) — treat it as `sonar: configured` even where `runbook_lane resolve` reports `not_configured` (its `credentials_config` block is missing; see the epic's Watches). An open Sonar issue is fixed in a pushed commit, or dismissed with a stated reason recorded as `{issue-key}: {reason}` in the run's progress record and transmitted through the plan-less transition verb, `plan-marshall:workflow-integration-sonar:sonar_rest transition --issue-key {key} --transition {falsepositive|wontfix}`. A dismissal the run cannot transmit is a blocker, never a silent pass. The merge gate reads the open-issue count at the head — `0` confirmed, or every remaining issue dismissed — and an `undecidable` read blocks.

## Claim Labels

- OBSERVED: the review of 2026-10-25 states this work in `doc/claude_review/cli/use-cases/proposals.adoc#CLI-UC-P-07`, `doc/claude_review/cli/use-cases/findings-onboarding-entry.adoc` — read at `doc/claude_review/cli/use-cases/proposals.adoc`
  - verdict: corroborated | checked_at: cc5794c9 | by: ui-improvements/cleanup | rescoped: n/a | evidence: origin/main: doc/claude_review/cli/use-cases/proposals.adoc:125 [#CLI-UC-P-07] 'The Config Contract'; findings-onboarding-entry.adoc exists
- Verify-first clause: the review was written against HEAD `c4dc9bb4` and read code only to confirm causes. Before each deliverable, re-read the named files at the current HEAD and confirm or refute every HYPOTHESIS above; a refuted cause re-scopes the deliverable and is reported, never silently worked around.

## Write-Boundary

The plan implementing this spec touches only its own repository source and tests (and, where a deliverable says so,
the sibling repository `plan-marshall-documentation`). It creates and edits NO file under `.plan/orchestrator/` other than its own
`inbox/{sender}-{seq}` message — the orchestrator owns every other ledger write — and reports
its outcome through its PR and its inbox message. The inbox exception's qualifiers and the
sole sanctioned write mechanism are stated in
`persona-plan-orchestrator/standards/orchestration-model.md` § Ledger Write-Boundary.
